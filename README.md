# PocketEncryption
Development source of an app designed to provide offline encryption services for any text, initially, with later possibility to expand into file and folder encryption later.
This project is nearing alpha. Will update readme as I make progress.

# Currently working on:
-Implementing easy-to-use encryption utilities using modern algorithms

# TODO:
-UI

-Input checking

-User warnings for everything that goes wrong (use Toasts? use a dedicated log inside UI? use popups?)


# Done:
-Basic encryption using old algorithm

-Encryption key secure storage using the Android Key Store

-Easy-use file r/w utilities
