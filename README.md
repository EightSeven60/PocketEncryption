# PocketEncryption
Development source of an app designed to provide offline encryption services for any text, initially, with later possibility to expand into file and folder encryption later.
This project is nearing alpha. Will update readme as I make progress.

The app's backbone is pretty much done now and can be used.

# Currently working on:

-Implementing master password

-Improving UI

# TODO:

-Romanian translation

-User warnings for everything that goes wrong (use Toasts? use a dedicated log inside UI? use popups?)

-Use threading to ensure responsiveness of UI

-Code cleanup and refactoring

-Implement option to use internet temporarily to send recovery email?


# Done:

-Implemented easy-to-use encryption utilities using modern algorithms

-Encryption key secure storage using the Android Key Store

-Easy-use, encrypted file r/w utilities

-Theming, partially

-UI (most important components are in place)
