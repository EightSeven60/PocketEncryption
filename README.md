# PocketEncryption
Development source of an app designed to provide offline encryption services for any text, initially, with later possibility to expand into file and folder encryption later.
This project is nearing alpha. Will update readme as I make progress.

The app's backbone is pretty much done now and can be used. Version 1.0 is coming after I optimise some slow code.
